## Messing around with the ISS

I am def not a pro when it comes to stuff like longitude and latitude 
but this has been pretty fun to play around with.

I actually caught it directly above my house but had messed up a data type
and did not get the hit.

Anyways I currently have this running here for free:
https://www.pythonanywhere.com/

It is really simple and easy to get setup, legit had this running in under 2
min. 

Anyways I made some revisions and I think I have this correctly set up now.

## For those who need it explained

This tracks the position of international space station vs. your current position
and not only alerts you but sends an email when it starts getting close and
again when it is above you.

It goes by amazingly fast, when I caught it before it was out of viewable range in 
under like a maybe a minute max.

Anyways anyone can run this.

Get your position here:
https://www.latlong.net/

and them to the variables.

If you want the email to send link your email and app password, if not 
put in a fake one.

You dont need the email, you can spin it up in a free cloud service like 
python anywhere: https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ and it refreshes the position
every 10 seconds using clear console.

Anyways ENJOY!
